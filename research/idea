# Name of Project:

Private Entrepreneur Invoice Generator


# Background of the Project:

As a private entrepreneur, I encountered a significant challenge in project monitoring
and financial compliance. In Ukraine, the government closely monitors business activities
to ensure that the income received by private entrepreneurs (PE) stems from legitimate work.
To prove this, entrepreneurs are required to issue specific receipts known as invoices,
which provide evidence of services rendered.

Invoices, typically generated by one party in a contract, are essential for documenting
the date, price, and description of the services provided. This process is critical for
compliance, as it not only confirms that the work is done legally but also ensures that
the services align with the entrepreneurâ€™s registered business activities under the KVED
system. For many PEs, staying within these guidelines allows them to benefit from a reduced
tax rate of 5% (compared to 19.5%).

However, the issue arises when generating invoices becomes an overwhelming task. Depending
on the nature of the business and the volume of transactions, an entrepreneur might need
to produce 10, 50, or even 100 invoices per month. This process can be extremely time-consuming,
taking hours or even days to complete, time that could otherwise be invested in growing the
business or increasing profits.

This inefficiency sparked the idea for my project: to create a streamlined, automated invoicing
system that saves entrepreneurs time, reduces human error, and ensures compliance with legal and
tax regulations. By solving this problem, the project not only boosts productivity but also
addresses a widespread pain point for private entrepreneurs, making it a critical tool for
those looking to focus on their business growth while remaining compliant with governmental standards.
